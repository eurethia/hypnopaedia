# hypnopaedia
I was inspired by BNW. I realize that my moral values are uncertain. Some times I want to contribute to my own country. Some times I just want to live a happy life with no worries or troubles. Some times I want to become the ultimate antagonist and blow up the world. Thoughts wrestle in my mind, making me a splitted idiot. So I want to apply hypnopaedia to myself.

## What this stupid thing will become?
1. Drag the audio file you want to repete into the repository
2. Run the script in terminal
3. Set how much time later you want it to start repeating
4. Set the number of times you want to let the audio repeat

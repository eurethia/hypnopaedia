# hypnopaedia
I was inspired by BNW. I realize that my moral values are uncertain. Some times I want to contribute to my own country. Some times I just want to live a happy life with no worries or troubles. Some times I want to become the ultimate antagonist and blow up the world. Thoughts wrestle in my mind, making me a splitted idiot. So I want to apply hypnopaedia to myself.

## What this stupid thing will become? (Make sure you have Python 3.9)
1. Download the whole repository
2. pip install playsound
3. Replace the audio file "test.m4a" by your own by dragging the audio file you want to learn into the repository (or you can test the program with "test.m4a")
4. Run the script in terminal by python3 main.py
5. Set how much time later you want it to start repeting
6. Set the number of times you want to let the audio repete
